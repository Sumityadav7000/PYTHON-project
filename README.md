Python Spiral Drawing with Turtle
This Python project demonstrates how to draw a colorful spiral pattern using the Turtle module. The Turtle module is a standard Python library for creating graphics and shapes by drawing on a canvas.

Overview
The script spiral.py contains the Python code to draw a colorful spiral pattern using Turtle graphics. The script utilizes a loop to draw a spiral shape, gradually increasing the line length and angle to create the spiral effect. Additionally, random colors are used for each segment of the spiral, resulting in a vibrant and dynamic visual output.

Features
Draws a colorful spiral pattern.
Utilizes random colors for each segment of the spiral.
Provides customizable parameters for spiral size and complexity.
How to Use
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the spiral.py script.
Run the script using the command python spiral.py.
Watch as the Python Turtle window opens and displays the drawn spiral pattern.
Customize
You can customize the script by adjusting parameters such as the starting position, line length, angle increment, and colors. Modify the variables a and b to change the starting position and other parameters to adjust the appearance of the spiral.
