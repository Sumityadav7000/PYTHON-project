Python Chessboard Drawing with Turtle
This Python project demonstrates how to draw a chessboard pattern using the Turtle module. The Turtle module is a standard Python library for creating graphics and shapes by drawing on a canvas.

Overview
The script chessboard.py contains the Python code to draw a chessboard pattern using Turtle graphics. The script utilizes nested loops to draw alternating squares of different colors to represent the chessboard's grid.

Features
Draws an 8x8 chessboard pattern.
Alternates between two colors (e.g., white and black) to represent the squares.
Utilizes the Turtle module for graphical drawing.
How to Use
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the chessboard.py script.
Run the script using the command python chessboard.py.
Watch as the Python Turtle window opens and displays the drawn chessboard pattern.
Customize
You can customize the script by adjusting the colors of the squares, the size of the squares, or the number of squares by modifying the appropriate variables in the script.
